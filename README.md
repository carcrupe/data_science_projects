## Machine learning with Python and R

### Python

[ML - Supervised learning](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/machineLearning)
In this module I have learnt how to deal with machine learning single and ensembled models. I have worked in three different projects:

[House pricing prediction](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/blob/master/machineLearning/HousePricingChallenge.ipynb)
[Diabetes predictor](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/blob/master/machineLearning/Classification%20-%20Pima%20Indians.ipynb)
[Car speed prediction](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/blob/master/machineLearning/Classification%20-%20Basic%20Car%20Speed.ipynb)

See also machine learning cheatsheet for quicker modeling:

## Natural Language Processing

[NLP](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/naturalLanguageProcessing/notebooks)
In this module different text processing libraries (nltk, sklearn, spacy, textblob) are explored, regular expressions, tokenizers, bags of words, vectors and Tfidf.

## Time Series Analysis

[Time series](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/blob/master/time_series/TSA.ipynb)
In this module I cover from the most basic concepts (dealing with dates, resampling, etc) to the SARIMA model, to better understand time series analysis.

## Recommendation systems

[Recommendation system](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/recommendation_systems)
A movie recommendation program is created. The steps of this module are as follows:

1. [Getting and analysing some data]
2. [Most popular movies]
3. [Metrics for recommender systems]
4. [Collaborative Filtering ]
	3.1 [Co-occurrence Matrix]
    3.2 [Memory-based CF]
    3.3 [Model-based CF]

## Deep learning - Image detection and Natural Language Processing

[Deep learning projects](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/deep_learning)
I have applied Keras and Tensorflow libraries to analyze and predict in four different projects:

[Digit recognition](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/blob/master/deepLearning/02_mnist_digits_orig.ipynb)
[NLP - Review prediction based on posted text](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/blob/master/deepLearning/03_imdb_reviews.ipynb)
[Cat & Dog classifier with convolotional networks](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/blob/master/deepLearning/04_convolutional_networks.ipynb)

## R

[Statistics and visualization in R](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/RStudio/R/statistics_and_probability)
[Visualization tools in R](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/RStudio/R/visualization)

[ML - supervised and unsupervised learning](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/RStudio/R/Machine_learning)

I have worked in some basic projects to get familiar with R and machine learning:
[Titanic](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/blob/master/RStudio/R/Machine_learning/Supervised_learning/Exercise_titanic.R)
