# Data Science projects


## Basic Linux and Python concepts, functions and structures

[Python Intro](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/python_basics) <br />
[Linux console Intro](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/linux_commands)

## How to clean, import and explore data with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn

[Data Science Intro](https://github.com/carcrupe/masterDataScience/tree/master/numpy_pandas_matplotlib) <br />
Get familiar with main libraries for data scientists. Learn by doing several exercises and small projects.

## Machine learning with Python and R

### Python

[ML - Supervised learning](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/tree/master/machine_learning) <br />
In this module I have learnt how to deal with machine learning single and ensembled models. I have worked in three different projects:

[House pricing prediction](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/blob/master/machine_learning/HousePricingChallenge.ipynb) <br />
[Diabetes predictor](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/blob/master/machine_learning/Classification%20diabetes.ipynb) <br />
[Car speed prediction](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/blob/master/machine_learning/Classification%20-%20Basic%20Car%20Speed.ipynb) <br />

## Natural Language Processing

[NLP](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/tree/master/natural_language_processing) <br />
In this module different text processing libraries (nltk, sklearn, spacy, textblob) are explored, regular expressions, tokenizers, bags of words, vectors and Tfidf.

## Time Series Analysis

[Time series](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/tree/master/time_series) <br />
In this module I cover from the most basic concepts (dealing with dates, resampling, etc) to the SARIMA model, to better understand time series analysis.

## Recommendation systems

[Recommendation system](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/tree/master/recommendation_systems) <br />
A movie recommendation program is created. The steps of this module are as follows:

1. Getting and analysing some data
2. Most popular movies
3. Metrics for recommender systems
4. Collaborative Filtering <br />
	4.1 Co-occurrence Matrix <br />
    	4.2 Memory-based CF <br />
    	4.3 Model-based CF <br />

## Deep learning - Image detection and Natural Language Processing

[Deep learning projects](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/tree/master/deep_learning) <br />

I have applied Keras and Tensorflow libraries to analyze and predict in three different projects:

[Digit recognition](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/blob/master/deep_learning/02_mnist_digits_orig.ipynb) <br />
[NLP - Review prediction based on posted text](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/blob/master/deep_learning/03_imdb_reviews.ipynb) <br />
[Cat & Dog classifier with convolotional networks](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/blob/master/deep_learning/04_convolutional_networks.ipynb) <br />

## R

Getting familiar with R libraries for Data Science: <br />
[Statistics and visualization in R](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/tree/master/RStudio/statistics_and_probability) <br />
[Visualization tools in R](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/tree/master/RStudio/visualization) <br />

[ML - supervised and unsupervised learning](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/tree/master/RStudio/machine_learning) <br />
I have worked in some basic projects to get familiar with R and machine learning:
[Titanic](https://github.com/carcrupe/data_science_projects/blob/master/RStudio/machine_learning/Supervised_learning/Example_1_glm_titanic_sols.Rmd)
